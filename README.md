# Plotter

A data-analysis-oriented library for drawing beautiful plots.

## Description

This library makes heavy use of the `matplotlib` library, therefore it is necessary to have some
understanding of that library.

Shortly, _Plotter_ makes it easy to create beautiful `matplotlib` plots by generating instances of
matplotlib object with preset values. In other words, it gives the user a faster and easier way of
rendering plots of analyzed data.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install _Plotter_ (Unix-like systems):

1. Clone the repository to a directory in your system.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to said folder.
3. Run the command
   ```bash
   python
   ```

## Usage

Once imported, the library will create 3 directories (that are not to be deleted):

1. The _log/_ directory is for storing the log files, which can always be
   ignored or turned off.
2. The _img/_ directory is for the picture generated by the library whenever
   user decides to save the plot created.
3. The _text/_ directory is for the text files (see below). The library will also
   create a blueprint for the aforementioned files.

### Text files

In order to display some text in the plot (e.g. the title, the names of the axes, etc.), the
user must create a text file identical to the one created by default inside _text/_ (that is,
_text_example.txt_). This way, the program will read that file and display the requested text.

### Example

For a basic graph, try the following piece of code.

```python
from grada import graphs as g
import numpy as np

# dataset to be drawn
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 50)
y = x**2
y_err = np.full(50, 0.5)

# define the text of the plot
text = g.Text("text/text_example.txt")

# create a canvas
canvas = g.Canvas("text/text.txt", log=True, save="prova")

# create a scatter plot of the data (with error bars)
scatter = ScatterPlot("firebrick", "o")
scatter.draw(canvas, text, x, y, yerr=y_err)

# create a fit curve
fit = Plot("black", ac=(0.01, 0.01))
fit.draw(canvas, text, x, lambda x: x**2)

# render the canvas
canvas.mainloop()
```

For information about `matplotlib` colors and marker types see the directory 'info'.
